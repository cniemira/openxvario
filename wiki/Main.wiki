= Introduction =
If you found this page, you are probably as well infected by the "build your own Variometer" virus. 
The openXvario is my contribution to the 9X community. 
It is designed to work together with the open source firmware open9x for the turnigy 9x transmitter. but with little modifications it should work with any Fr-Sky telemetry enabled system.

Hint: this prototype is not using the ppm signal from the receiver. new pictures will follow..
== Arduino Variometer / Altimeter over FR-Sky telemetry for open9x ==

=== Sensor data send to open9x ===
here´s an example how it might look in open9x:
https://openxvario.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/open9xTelemetryScreen.jpg

  * ALT => the relative altitude
  * VSpd => the vertical speed
  * Dist => 279.22 the absolute height as calculated form air pressure+temp
  * Cels => the input voltage of the arduino
  * RPM => 1056 mbar = the current air pressure (not the best resolution in this field...)
  * T1 => 25C the temperature measured by the ms5611
the dist and RPM fields are being "misused" a bit here :D

You can configure this to your liking by just uncommenting some lines in the code. e.g. you can choose what you want in the dist or RPM field: nothing, Altitude,Air pressure..

the following can be transmitted:
  * absolute altitude (ID 0x10 and 0x21)
  * supply voltage as VFAS Voltage ( id 0x39) or as cell 0 in id 0x06
  * temperature (from MS5611) as T1 ID 0x02
  * 6 single voltage values connected to the pins as configured as cell 1-6 in id 0x06
  * various other field for diagnostic purposed ( e.g. internal kalman filter parameters)

WARNING: Do NOT attempt to directly connect the 6 available cell voltages to your balance connector! This would only work for the first cell (from gnd) cell 2 and + would exceed the Arduino pin limits (keep the smoke in!)

= Configuring open9x =
visit the ConfigureVarioSettingsInOpen9x to learnm how to set the configuration in open9x

== Remote control your openXvario ==
You can (optionaly) use a servo channel to control the sensitivity of the vario from your transmitter. Just map a potentiometer from your 9X to the channel used to power up the openXvario and include the option in the configuration section of the source code. (see CompileOptions for details on how to enable this feature)

== Credits ==
I got the idea and a lot of code for this project from this thread: http://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1749208

The code to write the frsky packages is based on the work in this thread: http://fpv-community.de/showthread.php?18566-FrSky-Telemetrie-Protokoll

The voltage calibration code ist from here: http://provideyourown.com/2012/secret-arduino-voltmeter-measure-battery-voltage/

The kalman filter is based on the information from this site: http://interactive-matter.eu/blog/2009/12/18/filtering-sensor-data-with-a-kalman-filter/

and many thanks to bertrand for the changes to open 9x!
