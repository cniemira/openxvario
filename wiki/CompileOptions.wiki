The code of openxvario can be customized to suit your projects needs.

== Pin Assignments == 
{{{
#define PIN_SerialTX 10       // the pin to transmit the serial data to the frsky telemetry enabled receiver
#define PIN_ClimbLed 13       // the led used to indicate lift for debugging purposes

// Define a voltagepin if you want to transmit the value to open9x:
//#define PIN_VoltageCell1 0    //  Pin for measuring Voltage of cell 1 ( Analog In Pin! )
//#define PIN_VoltageCell2 1    //  Pin for measuring Voltage of cell 2 ( Analog In Pin! )
//#define PIN_VoltageCell3 2    //  Pin for measuring Voltage of cell 3 ( Analog In Pin! )
//#define PIN_VoltageCell4 3    //  Pin for measuring Voltage of cell 4 ( Analog In Pin! )
//#define PIN_VoltageCell5 6    //  Pin for measuring Voltage of cell 5 ( Analog In Pin! )
//#define PIN_VoltageCell6 7    //  Pin for measuring Voltage of cell 6 ( Analog In Pin! )
}}}
== Arduino LED Mode ==
{{{
// Choose how what the led will be used for (only 1 should be defined):
#define LED_BufferBlink       // Blink every time the averaging buffer complets one cycle
//#define LED_ClimbBlink        // Blink when climbRate > 0.15cm
}}}
== Absolute or relative Altitude display ==
// #define FORCE_ABSOLUTE_ALT // If defined, the height offset in open9x will be resetted upon startup, which results in an absolute height diplay.
                           // If not defined, open9x will use the first transmitted altitude as an internal offset, which results in an initial height of "0m"

== MS5611 Sensor I2C address ==
{{{
const int I2CAdd=0x77;                 // The I2C Address of the MS5611 breakout board ( normally 0x76 or 0x77 configured on the MS5611 module via a solder pin or fixed ...)
const int AverageValueCount=15;        // the number of values that will be used to calculate a new verage value
}}}
== Analog CLimbRate Mode == 
{{{
//#define ANALOG_CLIMB_RATE   // If defined, the clib rate will be written as PWM Signal to the defined port( Only use if you have to use a receiver missing the serial connection)
#define OutputClimbRateMin = -3; 
#define OutputClimbRateMax = 3;
#define PIN_AnalogClimbRate 9 // the pin used to write the data to the frsky a1 or a2 pin (could be 3,5,6,9,10,11)
}}}
== absolute Altitude in additional Fields == 
{{{
// for test purposes we can send the absolute height additionally as RPM ( RMPM 23430 = 234,30m)
//#define SEND_AltAsRPM // Altitude in RPM ;-) (resolution 30cm)

// for test purposes we can send the absolute height to the DIST field resolution: 0-327.68m=1cm/>327,68..3276,8m=10cm/>3276,8=1m)
// #define SEND_AltAsDIST // Altitude in DIST
// #define SEND_PressureAsDist // Pressure as DIST
